For the Uhr to work properly you must
_plug in all the cables_. In order. Left side letter
represents the _red_ connector, right side letter
represents the _black_ connector. The numbering follows the
red side. That's why you can remove only the last couple (I'm lazy
and I didn't want to track all the empty numbers).
