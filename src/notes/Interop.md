When a _thin reflector Beta_ is being paired with a _thin rotor B_,
its ring setting is not changed and its letter A is visible through the fourth rotor window
they will operate as a reflector **B** providing interoperability between _Enigma M3_ and _M4_.

The same happens on the same conditions when pairing a _thin reflector Gamma_ with a _thin rotor C_,
and they will operate as a reflector **C**.
