# enigma-ui

It was 2016 when I wrote the first version of EnigmaUI. It was a different
React, a different decade, I had a different job. Over time I integrated
other features into my implementation of the *Enigma machine*, like
the *Reflector D* and the *Uhr*. Providing a UI for them was
starting to be a challenge because I had to rewrite all the code into a
modern language. Thanks for the 2025s Christmas holidays!
