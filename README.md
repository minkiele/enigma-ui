# EnigmaUI

It was 2016 when I wrote the first version of EnigmaUI. It was a
different React, a different decade, I had a different job. Over
time I integrated other features into my implementation of the
_Enigma machine_, like the _Reflector D_ and the
_Uhr_. Providing a UI for them was starting to be a challenge
because I had to rewrite all the code into a modern language. But
then I did it. And now it exports and imports settings.
